# Comparisons

- Where we compare two values and as to what the output is (ex: Is 1 greater than 2? ; did the user click on this button? ; did the user sign in/sign out? ; is the user's password correct?)
- Values: True or False
- Comparisons return a boolean value
- Comparisons can also be assigned to a variable

# Conditionals

- The format for conditionals is "If Else". This is what all programming language uses, the only difference lies within their syntax.
- "If" is a reserved keyword (it has it's own colour ; for my theme, it is purple/blue)

"if () {} else {}"
// you make the comparison/condition within the parenthesis
// you put the displayed message within the curly brackets inside a console.log syntax
// use else statement for when the data is incorrect/false
