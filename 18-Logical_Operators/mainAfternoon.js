/* EXERCISE */
// Create a function ; two parameters which are two numbers ; subtract those two numbers ; log the output to the screen

/* MY CODE */
const subtraction = (a, b) => a - b;

function subtract(x, y) {
  console.log(x - y); // this is a side effect
}
// as much as possible, we only want our function to do one thing ; the example above does not just subtract, but it subtracts and prints (this is considered a side effect) */

// SCOPE - means in the same place sila ; same name and same space

-let age = 18;
-let age = 20;
NOT ALLOWED > BUT

let age = 18;

This will print the 19 and not 18. That is because a function has it's own scope (called a function/local scope). Also, there should only be one declaration per variable in one scope. You can only print insde the function scope and/or inside the global scope. 

Always remember that a function has it's own scope that it not going to be considered within the global scope. 

Lessen your global scope and don't make too much variables inside it, because it is prone to bugs (it is accessible anywhere, unlike the function scope) 

Use a main variable and call then within the function scope*/

// PURE FUNCTION - as much as possible, it only does the thing that you need it to do (EX: only adding one number)

}

console.log(addition(1, 2));
console.log(addition(5, 5));

// using it in via an arrow syntax approach ; this has no side effects and it is a pure function
const addAndPrint = (f, g) => f + g;
